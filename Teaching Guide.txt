Phase 1: Core Django Fundamentals
🎯 Goal: Understand Django’s structure, MVT architecture, and ORM.
- Environment Setup
- Install Python, virtualenv, Django, DRF.
- Create a Django project: library_project.
- Create an app: library.
- Django Basics
- Understand MVT (Model-View-Template).
- Learn how URLs, views, and templates work.
- Practice with a homepage (index.html) that says “Welcome to Library System”.
- Database Models
- Define models for core entities:
- Book (title, author, ISBN, is_available, category, published_date).
- Member (name, email, membership_date).
- Borrow (book, member, borrowed_date, return_date).
- Run migrations, test in Django Admin.
- Django Admin
- Register models.
- Customize list displays, filters, and search.
- 🛠️ Checkpoint: You can add books and members via the Django Admin.


Phase 2: Django REST Framework Basics
🎯 Goal: Build APIs for your models.
- Serializers
- Create serializers for Book, Member, and Borrow.
- APIView & ViewSets
- Implement basic CRUD APIs:
- /api/books/ → List & Create.
- /api/books/<id>/ → Retrieve, Update, Delete.
- /api/members/ → Manage members.
- Routers
- Use DRF’s DefaultRouter for automatic URL mapping.
- Testing APIs
- Use Django shell, Postman, or cURL to test endpoints.
🛠️ Checkpoint: You can create/list/update/delete books and members via API.


Phase 3: Authentication & Permissions
🎯 Goal: Secure the API.
- User Authentication
- Add django.contrib.auth.
- Use DRF Token Authentication or Simple JWT.
- Create endpoints for user registration & login.
- Permissions
- Admin can manage all records.
- Members can only view books and their borrow history.
🛠️ Checkpoint: Only logged-in users can access the API.


Phase 4: Borrowing System
🎯 Goal: Implement book lending logic.
- Borrow API
- Endpoint for borrowing a book:
- Check if available.
- Update is_available = False.
- Create a Borrow record.
- Return API
- Mark book as returned.
- Update availability.
- Validation
- Prevent borrowing if already borrowed.
- Enforce max borrow limit (e.g., 3 books per member).
🛠️ Checkpoint: Members can borrow and return books correctly.


Phase 5: Advanced Features
🎯 Goal: Enhance functionality & user experience.
- Filtering & Search
- Search books by title, author, category.
- Filter books by availability.
- Pagination
- Paginate book listings.
- Signals
- Send notifications (e.g., email when a book is borrowed).
- Custom Permissions
Example: Only staff can add/remove books.


Phase 6: Extra Features (Optional but Strong)
🎯 Goal: Move towards a production-ready system.
- Reports & Analytics
- Track most borrowed books.
- Track overdue books.
- Celery + Redis
- Send overdue reminders as background tasks.
- Swagger / DRF Spectacular
- Auto-generate API docs.
- Dockerize the App
- Learn containerization.
- Deploy
- Deploy to Render, Railway, or Heroku.
